## // What you can do

**Chat with any AI** — connect to OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, Ollama, and more. Or run models directly in your browser with WebLLM. No API key needed.

**Write & organize** — take notes in pocket-card folders, track tasks with progress bars, and write documents in a rich-text editor. Export as Word, Markdown, or HTML.

**Research anything** — give ChPio a topic and it'll search the web, read sources, and write you a report. Powered by Tavily.

**Your email, smarter** — connect your email account and let AI triage your inbox. Auto-classify as urgent, FYI, newsletter, or spam. Get AI-drafted replies.

**Create images** — generate images with OpenAI, Together AI, Pollinations, or your own custom endpoint.

**Remember everything** — save facts from any chat to Memory. ChPio recalls them in future conversations.

**Organize with projects** — group chats by project with custom skills and instructions. Give each project its own personality.

**ChPio Mode** — toggle the sparkle button and your AI becomes ChPio — a cool friend with opinions, not a corporate chatbot. It remembers your goals, celebrates wins, and gives you structured choices when you're stuck. More on this below.

## // Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niamhramadhaan/Chpio.git (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
cd Chpio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you'll see the onboarding screen. Click **"Add an API key to get started"** or go to **Settings → Providers**, paste your key, hit **Sync**, and you're chatting.

Don't have an API key? [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) gives you access to hundreds of models with one key. Or use **WebLLM** to run models locally in your browser — zero setup.

## // Features

### Talk to any AI

Bring your own API key from any provider — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, Google Gemini, Together AI, Fireworks, and more. Or run models locally with Ollama, llama.cpp, or WebLLM.

ChPio streams responses in real-time, shows the model's thinking process, and lets you edit or regenerate anything.

<img width="540" height="472" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 134538" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f6eecda-0ad3-459d-a146-4a06d15218aa" />


Attach files — PDFs, DOCX, images — and the AI reads them. Send a screenshot, drop a contract, or paste a codebase. The context goes straight to the model.

<img width="540" height="470" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 135007" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0acd6f7-48cf-4d60-8321-59c51bec0f5f" />

Save important facts to Memory mid-conversation. Next time you chat, ChPio already knows your preferences, project context, and past decisions.


### Write & organize

**Notes** — jot things down in pocket-card folders. Add tasks with checkboxes, pin important notes, drag them between folders. Everything's searchable.

<img width="540" height="896" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 114329" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53905798-2b83-47f2-8af9-619517b65d7d" />


Open a note and you get a clean editor with task lists, links, and quick actions — export as text, duplicate, move to another folder, or pin it to your active chat for reference.

<img width="540" height="198" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 135508" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53599259-7769-41bb-8cd4-cfd121939bf8" />


**Documents** — a full rich-text editor (ﾉ´Ŵ`)ﾉ*: ・ﾟ✧ with markdown support. Write with tables, code blocks, lists. Preview live. Export as Word (.docx), Markdown, or HTML.

<img width="480" height="282" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 142034" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d922a2-0801-4cee-98dc-705ac26bf00f" />

### Research anything

Type a question and ChPio runs a multi-step research pipeline: it plans the search, reads sources, evaluates what's useful, and writes you a structured report. You can expand source cards to see what was extracted, and save the report as a document.

Needs a [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com) (free: 1000 searches/month). Set it up in **Settings → Research**.

### Your email, smarter

Connect your email account (IMAP/SMTP) and ChPio becomes an AI-powered inbox. It auto-triages each email — urgent, FYI, newsletter, or spam — and extracts topic tags.

Compose, reply, forward. Get AI-drafted replies based on the thread context — just hit "Draft" and ChPio writes a response you can edit before sending.

Requires the companion email server (included in `/server`). See [Detailed Setup](#detailed-setup) below.

### Create images

Generate images from text prompts using OpenAI (DALL-E, gpt-image-1), Together AI (FLUX, SDXL), Pollinations, or your own custom endpoint. Download, copy prompts, or send images directly to chat.

<img width="540" height="890" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 115210" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6261e3-2e57-4274-9c67-fc055053f7c9" />

Set up in **Settings → Image Gen**. Open from the bottom dock (⋯ menu).

### Go local

Run AI models directly in your browser — no API key, no server, no install. Powered by WebLLM with WebGPU acceleration. Requires Chrome or Edge 113+.

Models download on first use (~0.7-2 GB) and get cached locally. Supported: Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Gemma 2, SmolLM2, and more.


### Organize with projects

Group related chats under a project. Give each project custom **skills** (what the AI should know) and **instructions** (how it should behave). A coding project gets a different AI personality than a writing project.

<img width="540" height="364" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 140722" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b57422-7539-4459-9b35-e0d0292b424a" />

### ChPio Mode

Most AI assistants are polite robots. ChPio Mode is different — hit the sparkle button and your AI stops being *an assistant* and starts being **yours**. A companion that knows your name, tracks what matters to you, and has opinions about things.

<img width="540" height="434" alt="Recording 2026-06-26 134227" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a2df78-9a46-4d2a-9bf4-6e635d2dd2fe" />


#### ChPio has moods

```
  ( ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ )      idle — just vibing, waiting for you
  (  •̀ ᴖ •́  )     thinking — hold on, working on it
  (◕‿◕✿)        responding — got something for you
  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧  celebrating — goal crushed, let's go
  (*≧ω≦*)       welcoming — hey, you're back
```

#### It grows with you

ChPio remembers what you tell it — your projects, your preferences, your goals. Every fact you save, every decision you make, every pattern you follow — it adds up. The more you use it, the more it gets you.

Each session starts fresh, but the memories carry forward. You're not starting over. You're continuing.

#### It has opinions

ChPio doesn't hedge everything. It'll tell you when something's a bad idea. It gives you **structured choices** instead of open-ended questions — pick from options, don't stare at a blank prompt.

When things break: *"That broke. Let's fix it."* Not *"I apologize for the inconvenience."*

When things work: *"Nice, that worked."* The purple glow is the fist bump.

#### Goal tracking

Tell ChPio what you're working on. It tracks your goals across sessions, breaks them into steps, checks in on progress, and celebrates when you finish. The avatar pulses purple — that's the win.

**Toggle it** with the ✨ sparkle button in the chat input, or `⌘K` → "Toggle ChPio Mode".
